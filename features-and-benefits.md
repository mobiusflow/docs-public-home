# Features and Benefits

The **Mobius**Flow**®** ecosystem evolves based on customer requirements and runs a library of standard and customer specific code (or nodes) to allow connectivity of an ever increasing number of sensors, control systems, heating, ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), lighting, office work flows (including people sensors and door entry systems), retail outlets and manufacturing monitoring equipment to name but a few.

### **Remote Deployment**

_Less people on site._

**Mobius**Flow**®** can also be used on closed networks when outside access is blocked or unavailable, such as Airports or Secure Installations.

### **Single Infrastructure**

_Saving multiple use cases_

Cost and complexity reduction by using one system to collect and control data providing lower cost of ownership.

### **Easy to use and deploy**

_Flow based low code programming._

Staff training allows a reduction of external input lowering cost of ownership.

### **Combine multiple use cases**

_Uses a single, simple platform._

Cost reductions through business intelligence, improve efficiencies though a single source of data. Building analytics and employee health enables bigger business benefits.

### **Local control and decision making**

_Reduces waste_

Having the option to react quickly can improve efficiencies and significantly reduce downtime on machinery and equipment.

### **Not just IoT device monitoring**

_Analyse, React and Control_

Independence from internet allows action based control. Example: Water leak detection automatically shuts off water valve. Occupancy sensor control lighting and HVAC based on usage.

### **Third Party Integration**

_Open / Easy / Simple_

Easy to adopt and acquire IoT data from multiple sources.

### **Instant IoT Capability**

_Rapid Deployment_

By using industry standards and open protocols you can introduce IoT within your organisation quickly.

### **VPN (Virtual Private Network) Connectivity**

_for remote deployment / configuration_

**Mobius**Flow**®** can also be used on closed networks when outside access is blocked or unavailable, such as Airports or Secure Installations.
